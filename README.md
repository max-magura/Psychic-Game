# Max's Psychic Game

This is a game I made to help teach me some of the fundamentals of Javascript.

## Gameplay
The object of the game is to try and guess the random word that the computer has selected. You win a point by guessing correctly and gain a lost point by running out of guesses. When either happen, a new letter is generated.

## Play The Game
